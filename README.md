# 🐍 Py30

🔁 Personal reboot into programming.

This repository documents my deliberate restart of the programming fundamentals using **Python**, following the structure and spirit of the **30 Days of Python** challenge by [Asabeneh Yetayeh](https://github.com/Asabeneh).

## 📘 About

This challenge is based on:  
🔗 https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python

The goal is not speed or surface-level familiarity, but rebuilding a **solid mental model** of programming from the ground up.

After branching into many different areas of programming too early, I lost clarity and depth. This repository marks a conscious reset — returning to fundamentals, writing code manually, understanding each concept fully, and rebuilding discipline.

## 🧠 Philosophy

- 🧩 Start from first principles  
- 🚫 No shortcuts, no copy-paste learning  
- 🎯 Emphasis on understanding over completion  
- 🔁 Small, correct steps taken consistently  

Each day represents focused work on a specific set of concepts, with code written intentionally and versioned to track real progress.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This is both:

- 📓 A learning log  
- 📚 A reference point  

A reboot toward becoming a **reliable programmer**, grounded in fundamentals rather than fragmented knowledge.
