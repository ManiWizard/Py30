# Py30

Personal reboot into programming.

This repository documents my deliberate restart of the programming fundamentals using **Python**, following the structure and spirit of the **30 Days of Python** challenge by Asabeneh.

## About

This challenge is based on:
[https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python)

The goal is not speed or surface-level familiarity, but rebuilding a **solid mental model** of programming from the ground up.

After branching into many different areas of programming too early, I lost clarity and depth. This repository marks a conscious reset — returning to fundamentals, writing code manually, understanding each concept fully, and rebuilding discipline.

## Philosophy

* Start from first principles
* No shortcuts, no copy-paste learning
* Emphasis on understanding over completion
* Small, correct steps taken consistently

Each day represents focused work on a specific set of concepts, with code written intentionally and versioned to track real progress.

## Purpose

This is both:

* a learning log
* and a reference point

A reboot toward becoming a **reliable programmer**, grounded in fundamentals rather than fragmented knowledge.
